<h1>Specifying the XFlow file location</h1>
<p>To specify the XFlow file, you can edit the unit operation. There are two methods; the XFlow file can be 
loaded automatically each time the unit is run, or the currently stored flow data can be loaded from an XFlow 
file directly from the Settings tab. 
<p>To automatically load the XFlow file each time the unit is solved, hit Browse to specify an XFlow file location.
Then tick the Automatically Load check box. The current file name can be removed by clicking the Reset button.
<p>The XFlow file location and auto-load option are exposed as public parameters to the unit operation.
<p>To load a the <a href="XSaveFlowData.htm">current flow data</a> manually, click the Load Now button.
