<h1>XFlowSaver</h1>
<p>The XFlowSaver unit operation's main purpose is to save an <a href="XFlow.htm">XFlow file</a>.
<p>The unit operation has a feed port, which much be connected to a material stream. This feed port
will be the source of stream information in the saved XFlow file. The unit also has a product port. 
This can optionally be connected to a material stream. To save the results of a product stream in your 
flowsheet, simply connect the stream to the feed port of an XFlowSaver unit. If you want to save an 
internal stream in the flowsheet, insert an XFlowSaver unit in the stream and connect both the feed
and product ports. 
<p>The saved XFlow file can be used to populate a feed stream in any CAPE-OPEN compliant flowsheet 
environment using the <a href="XFlowLoader.htm">XFlowLoader</a> unit operation, or can be parsed 
using any XML parser to extract stream data in 3rd party applications. A <a href="Viewer.htm">stand-alone XFlow viewer</a>
is also available to view the content of XFlow files.
