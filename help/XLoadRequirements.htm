<h1>Minimum XFlow file requirement</h1>
<p>For the XFlowLoader to succesfully populate a stream, at least the properties "Flow Rate" and 
"Composition" or the property "Compound Flow Rate" is required in the <a href="XFlow.htm">XFlow file</a>
in either mole or mass basis. Absence of the "Flow Rate" and "Composition" properties in favour of the 
"Compound Flow Rate" is only supported if the total flowrate is non-zero.
<p>The composition and compound flow rate maps to compounds, which need to 
map to the compounds that are present in the stream to be populated. For the 
<a href="CompoundMapping.htm">compound mapping</a> to be set up, the XFlow file must at least 
contain the compounds, and for each compound a compound ID.
<p>In addition, the <a href="XLoadFlash.htm">phase equilibrium</a> must be calculated on the product stream.
For the TP flash, the XFlow file must contain "Pressure" and "Temperature". For the P-VF flash, the XFlow file 
must contain "Pressure" and either "Vapor Fraction" for the overall phase, or "Phase Fraction" for the phases.
For the PH flash, the XFlow file must contain "Pressure", as well as the reference state corrected enthalpy, 
reference state phase name, reference state phase state of aggregation, reference temperature and reference pressure
for adjusting the corrected enthalpy to meet the enthalpy of the target thermodynamics. These enthalpy options
are saved by the <a href="XFlowSaver.htm">XFlowSaver unit operation</a> if the <a href="XOptions.htm">Write Enthalpy</a> option
is enabled.
