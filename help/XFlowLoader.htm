<h1>XFlowLoader</h1>
<p>The XFlowLoader unit operation's main purpose is to load an <a href="XFlow.htm">XFlow file</a> and 
use this to populate a feed stream in a flowsheet.
<p>The unit operation has only a product port, which much be connected to a material stream. This product port
will be populated with overall flow and composition, and two more properties to calculate the phase equilibrium.
The source of the data for the product stream is a previously saved XFlow file. 
<p>The  XFlow file may have been previously saved by an <a href="XFlowSaver.htm">XFlowSaver unit operation</a> 
or any other application that writes material stream data into the XFlow file format.
