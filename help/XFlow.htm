<h1>XFlow files</h1>
<p>The XFlow file format is an open, XML based, file format designed to exchange material stream data
between flowsheet simulators. XFlow files are written by the <a href="XFlowSaver.htm">XFlowSaver</a> unit 
operation and read by the <a href="XFlowLoader.htm">XFlowLoader</a> unit operation, but any 3rd party
application can easily parse or write XFlow files.
<h2>XFlow file format</h2>
<p>The XFlow file format is case sensitive.

<h3>XFlow node</h3>
<p>This is the top-level node in the document. It does not have attributes. 
<p> Sub-nodes: <tt>Property</tt>, <tt>Compound</tt>, <tt>Phase</tt>, <tt>AutoFlash</tt> and the enthalpy state nodes.

<h3>Property</h3>
<p>The property node contains the value of a property. It can be sub-node of the <tt>XFlow</tt> node (an overall 
property), a <tt>Compound</tt> node (a compound property) or a <tt>Phase</tt> node (a phase property).
<p>Attributes:
<p><table id="xmltab">
<tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>Name</tt></td><td>Display name of the property. Properties understood by FlowExchange are listed in the <a href="PropConf.htm">property configuration file</a> along with the unit of measure. 
<tr><td><tt>UnitOfMeasure</tt></td><td>Unit of measure. Always SI units. 
</table>
<p>The text content of the <tt>Property</tt> node contains the English formatted property value. For an array, multiple values are separated by a semi-colon.
<p>There can be multiple <tt>Property</tt> nodes in each <tt>XFlow</tt>, <tt>Compound</tt> or <tt>Phase</tt> node, but
for each <tt>Property</tt> node with the same parent, the combination of <tt>Name</tt> and <tt>UnitOfMeasure</tt> must be unique.
<p> Sub-nodes: none.

<h3>Compound</h3>
<p>The <tt>Compound</tt> node describes a compound. It does not have attributes. 
<p> Sub-nodes: <tt>ID</tt>, <tt>Name</tt>, <tt>CAS</tt>, <tt>Formula</tt> and <tt>Property</tt>.
<p>There can be multiple <tt>Compound</tt> nodes in an <tt>XFlow</tt> node, but each compound must have 
a unique ID.
<p>The <tt>Compound</tt> node does not contain text.

<h3>Phase</h3>
<p>The <tt>Phase</tt> node describes a phase. It does not have attributes. 
<p> Sub-nodes: <tt>Name</tt>, <tt>StateOfAggregation</tt>, <tt>KeyCompound</tt> and <tt>Property</tt>.
<p>There can be multiple <tt>Phase</tt> nodes in an <tt>XFlow</tt> node, but each phase must have 
a unique name.
<p>The <tt>Phase</tt> node does not contain text.

<h3>ID</h3>
<p>The <tt>ID</tt> node is required sub-node of a <tt>Compound</tt>. The contained text is the ID of the 
compound, and may differ from the textual name of the compound (which is presented to the user). It does
not have attributes.
<p>The <tt>Compound</tt> node must contain exactly one <tt>ID</tt> node.
<p> Sub-nodes: none.

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>The <tt>Name</tt> node is required sub-node of a <tt>Phase</tt>. For a <tt>Compound</tt> node, the <tt>Name</tt> node
is optional, and if absent the name is assumed equal to the ID. The text contained in the <tt>Name</tt> node is the name of
the container node. The <tt>Name</tt> node not have attributes.
<p>The <tt>Compound</tt> node can contain one <tt>ID</tt> node. The <tt>Phase</tt> node must contain exactly one <tt>ID</tt> node.
<p> Sub-nodes: none.

<h3>CAS</h3>
<p>The <tt>CAS</tt> node is an optional sub node for a <tt>Compound</tt> node. Its contained 
text is the CAS registry number for the compound. The <tt>CAS</tt> node not have attributes.
<p>The <tt>Compound</tt> can contain one <tt>CAS</tt> node.
<p> Sub-nodes: none.

<h3>Formula</h3>
<p>The <tt>Formula</tt> node is an optional sub node for a <tt>Compound</tt> node. Its contained 
text is the chemical formula for the compound (brutto, nomenclature according to Hill). 
The <tt>Formula</tt> node not have attributes.
<p>The <tt>Compound</tt> can contain one <tt>Formula</tt> node.
<p> Sub-nodes: none.

<h3>StateOfAggregation</h3>
<p>The <tt>StateOfAggregation</tt> node is a recommended sub node for a <tt>Phase</tt> node. Its contained 
text is the state of aggregation for the phase. Valid values are "Vapor", "Liquid", "Solid" and "Unknown".
The <tt>StateOfAggregation</tt> node not have attributes.
<p>The <tt>Phase</tt> can contain one <tt>StateOfAggregation</tt> node.
<p> Sub-nodes: none.

<h3>KeyCompound</h3>
<p>The <tt>KeyCompound</tt> node is an optional node for a <tt>Phase</tt> node. Its contained 
text is the ID of a compound expected to be present in the highest concentration in the phase. 
The value must match the content of the <tt>ID</tt> sub-node of one of the <tt>Compound</tt> nodes.
The <tt>KeyCompound</tt> node not have attributes.
<p>The <tt>Phase</tt> can contain one <tt>KeyCompound</tt> node.
<p> Sub-nodes: none.

<h3>AutoFlash</h3>
<p>The <tt>AutoFlash</tt> is a suggestion written by the <a href="XFlowSaver.htm">XFlowSaver unit operation</a>
on how the phase equilibrium of the stream should be calculated. The contained text summarizes the flash
conditions.
<p><table id="xmltab">
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>TP</tt></td><td>Flash the target stream at specified temperature and pressure</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>PVF</tt></td><td>Flash the target stream at specified pressure and molar vapor fraction</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>PH</tt></td><td>Flash the target stream at specified temperature and enthalpy</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The <tt>XFlow</tt> can contain one <tt>AutoFlash</tt> node.
<p> Sub-nodes: none.

<h3>Enthalpy state nodes</h3>
<p>The enthalpy contained in an XFlow file is relative to a mixture enthalpy of a given phase at overall conditions, 
at given pressure and temperature. The enthalpy corrected for this reference enthalpy, along with the conditions
for the reference enthalpy, are stored so that a target stream can be at specified enthalpy even if the thermodynamic
system used for the target stream is inconsistent with the thermodynamic system that was used to create the XFlow file.
<p>The enthalpy state is optional, but if absent or incomplete, the <a href="XFlowLoader.htm">XFlowLoader</a> unit
will not be able to use enthalpy specifications for phase equilibrium of the target stream.
<p>The molar and mass based enthalpies are both optional and not mutually exclusive (if the molecular weights are known
in the target thermodynamic system, they are interchangeable). The reference state details are of no use if not 
at least the molar or mass based enthalpy is stored, and vice versa, the enthalpies are of no use if not the 
entire reference state is stored.
<p>Each of the data items is stored as an English formatted contained text of a sub node of the <tt>XFlow</tt> node.
Each of the sub-nodes must appear at most one time. The sub nodes and their meaning are listed in below table.
<p><table id="xmltab">
<tr><th>Sub-node</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>MolarEnthalpy</tt></td><td>The difference in J/mol between the overall enthalpy of the stream and that of the reference phase at overall composition at reference pressure and temperature.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>SpecificEnthalpy</tt></td><td>The difference in J/kg between the overall enthalpy of the stream and that of the reference phase at overall composition at reference pressure and temperature.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>EnthalpyReferencePressure</tt></td><td>The reference pressure in Pa.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>EnthalpyReferenceTemperature</tt></td><td>The reference temperature in K.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>EnthalpyReferencePhase</tt></td><td>The name of the reference phase.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>EnthalpyReferencePhaseAggregationState</tt></td><td>The state of aggregation of the reference phase</td></tr>
