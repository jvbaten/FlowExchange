<h1>Product flash</h1>
<p>The product stream of any CAPE-OPEN unit operation must be in phase equilibrium. The XFlowLoader
unit operation must therefore perform a phase equilibrium calculation on the product stream. The 
type of phase equilibrium specification can be configured from the Settings page of the XFlowLoader
user interface.
<p>The following options are available:
<UL>
<LI>Automatic (default)
<LI>Pressure and Temperature (TP): the product stream is flashed using a pressure and temperature specification
<LI>Pressure and Vapor Fraction (P-VF): the product stream is flashed using a pressure and vapor fraction specification
<LI>Pressure and Enthalpy (PH): the product stream is flashed using a pressure and enthalpy specification. The enthalpy
is calculated from the corrected enthalpy and reference state specifications in the <a href="XFlow.htm">XFlow file</a>.
</UL>
<h2>Automatic flash</h2>
<p>By default, the flash type is automatically determined. If an AutoFlash recommended flash entry is present in the XFlow file, 
this will be used. Such a flash recommendation is written by the <a href="XFlowSaver.htm">XFlowSaver unit operation</a>
if the <a href="XOptions.htm">recommended flash</a> options is enabled.
<p>If an AutoFlash entry is not present in the XFlow file (or if its content is not recognized), the XFlowLoader
unit operation will perform:
<UL>
<LI>a P-VF flash if a phase with state of aggregation "Vapor" is present in the XFlow file with a "Phase Fraction" of 0 or 1, and multiple phases are present.
<LI>a PH flash if the number of compounds is less than the number of phases (e.g. 1 compound in 2 phases). The number of compounds is determined 
from non-zero compositions after <a href="CompoundMapping.htm">compound mapping</a>, where a composition is considered zero if smaller than 10<sup>-10</sup>.
<LI>a TP flash if none of the above conditions hold
</UL>
