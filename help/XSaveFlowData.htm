<h1>Current flow data</h1>
<p>As soon as flow data is available (after the first run), the unit's user interface will contain a Flow Data 
tab that summarizes the flow data currently in memory and that was last saved to <a href="XFlow.htm">Xflow file</a>.
<p>Click on the headings to open and close them.
<p>The entire content of the grid (with all sections unfolded) can be copied to the clipboard from the Edit menu.
The clipboard format is text, tab delimited, and strings are in double quotes. This is a format commonly used for spread
sheet data.
<p>The flow viewer in the edit dialog is the same as the <a href="Viewer.htm">stand-alone XFlow viewer</a> that opens
when double clicking a .xflow file.
